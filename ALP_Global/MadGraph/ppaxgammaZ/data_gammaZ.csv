#: description: The measured single-differential cross sections in photon transverse momenta for the pure electroweak Z$\gamma$jj production. The total uncertainty of the observed results includes the stastical uncertianty and the systematic uncertainty, while the uncertainty of the predicted results is the theoretical uncertainty from the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The last bin includes overflow events.
