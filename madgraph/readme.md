* p p > t t~, (t > l+ vl b), (t~ > l- vl~ b~) 

(note change in definition to include off-shell W bosons).

This will apply a transverse mass cut on each set of W decay products (l+ and vl, l- and vl~).

See lines 37-84.

See also notebooks/ttbar_offshell_withcuts.ipynb for an example of how we can verify that the cuts were actually applied.
